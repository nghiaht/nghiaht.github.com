### Past-n-Ongoing Projects (latest first)

The following lines would use the pronoun "I" very much! Because it is my stories.

* Slither.io-based game services

  I take main responsibility to develop the game services, a RESTed API providing flows for clients, from payments to other game features.
  This project is written in Node.JS, using Loopback (IBM) framework, and yup, Loopback is still a good choice (like Django in Python).
  
  I also developed a background-services for collecting stats, player's status, also in Node.JS 
  but now we (my team) are moving into Java (Spring Boot), using RabbitMQ, Redis for easier scales.
  
  Along with the services is the admin backend admin, I have had much time working with React, Redux to develop them.
    
* Fishing-hunt game

  I had few first steps co-working on this project, I supported the development of payment system, integrated 
  third party payment providers from old protocols like SOAP to the newer ones like REST API.
  
  I also developed the admin backend using React, Redux.

* The Parking System
  
  When I first started my first internship , I worked on and developed new features for the existing parking system backend, 
  implement parking fee paygate, fees are calculated by blocks or turns.
  
  I also experienced long and hard work of reports in .xlsx format.
  
  At the nearly end of this project, I developed a coupon-based system, that means this parking system is put within a centre mall, supermarket..;
  customers use coupons to discount their parking fee.
  
  This project is written in Python, using Django framework, and after a long time getting along with that, 
  Django is still a good choice, provides flexible, built-in and fast prototype for similar projects 

### Others

* Community Language Translations

  I love translating English to Vietnamese, when I was young (several years ago), I spend my thinkings (perfect for choosing the right words) to translate free, open source projects.
  Including: Transifex, Ubuntu, Moodle, Univernal Subtitles. Now I don't have much time!

* "Freemind" authors

  High school's literature books had some effects to my writing style. Sometimes I spend times writing posts, and I think it's not bad.
