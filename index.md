* Community Language Translations

  I love translating from English to Vietnamese, when I was young (several years ago), I spend my thinkings (perfect for choosing the right words) to translate free, open source projects.
  Including: Transifex, Ubuntu, Moodle, Univernal Subtitles, Crowdin. Now I don't have much time!
  
* "Freemind" authors

  High school's literature books had some effects to my writing style. Sometimes I spend times writing posts with first philosophy: just small things, not to be extraordinary.
